                    <p class="about--des--first-para">
                        Là Việt Coffee was established in August 2013, taking a unique and pioneering stance in Vietnam's coffee market by focusing on Arabica beans, which at that time accounted for less than 10% of Vietnam’s coffee-growing area. The motto, “There is no special coffee, only special people making coffee with dedication,” captures their emphasis on craftsmanship and passion. Là Việt’s first “factory-style” coffee shop opened in Da Lat—the heart of Vietnam’s finest Arabica farms—reflecting their dedication to both the local sourcing and meticulous production of quality coffee. Since its founding, Là Việt has continually asserted its bold, flavorful identity, leaving a lasting impression on customers, much like the lingering aroma of their signature roasts.

                    <p class="about--des--first-para">
                        The vision for Là Việt is to champion Vietnamese specialty coffee, shifting the focus to Arabica and elevating Vietnam’s coffee reputation globally. Founder Quang's goal has been to create a seamless farm-to-cup process, meticulously managing each stage to preserve the essence of every coffee bean. This approach not only safeguards the quality but also ensures fair compensation and sustainable incomes for everyone involved.
